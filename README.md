## 🖥️ Features

- **Sleek, Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly interface using React and TailwindCSS.
- **Realistic Simulation:** Custom random data generators (normal, Poisson, uniform, exponential) model real-world wireless channel behaviors.
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust parameters like power, data rate, receiver mode, and instantly see the impact.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Responsive, animated charts for instant feedback.
- **Extensible:** Ready to connect to real hardware or extend to more complex scenarios.
